SDLC
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

It is a process adopt by IT industries to develop accurate and quality of softwares.

There are six phases in SDLC.

1)Feasibility study 

2)Analysis 

3)Designing 

4)Coding 

5)Testing 

6)Delivery and Maintainence

1)Feasibility study 
--------------------
Feasibility study completely depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical Feasibility 
	E - Economical Feasibility
	L - Legal Feasibility 
	O - Operational Feasibility 
	S - Schedule Feasbility 

All the above information they will keep in a document called BDD.
Here BDD stands for Business Design Document.

2)Analysis 
-----------
In analysis phase, system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements.

They will keep that information in a document called SRS.

Here SRS stands for Software Requirement Specification.


3)Designing 
------------
We have two types of designing.

1)High level designing 
---------------------
In high level designing , we will design main/major modules.

Manager is responsible to perform high level designing.


2)Low level designing 
-----------------------
In low level designing , we will design child/sub modules.

Team lead / project lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

They will keep this information in a document called PDD/TDD.

Here PDD stands for Project Designed Document.
Here TDD stands for Technical Designed Document.

4)Coding 
----------
In coding phase, developers will involved.

All the developers will generate the build(code).

Once the build is ready then developer is responsible to perform white box testing.

5)Testing
------------
In this phase testing team or QA team will involved.

They will use one software component called STLC to test the project/code.

QA team is also responsible to perform black box testing.


6)Delivery and maintainence
---------------------------
Before delivery they will perform UAT testing.

UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

It is categories into two types.

i)Alpha testing

ii)Beta testing
